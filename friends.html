<h2>Big Events</h2>

  <li><p>[1] <b>Brithday on 14/10/22</b>,
  I had a wonderful dinner party with Jiasheng Liu, Yu Zhao, Xue Yuan and Aoyue Zhang. Then I went back to the 302 Seminer Room
    to celebrate the day with Changxin Zhai, Jinyu Qiu, Hao Guo, Jinyang Zhou and Man Zhang. Guo gave me a computer stand, which is the most practised thing I received today.
    A lovely puppy pillow was received from Zhou and I could hug it using both of my hands. An ingenuity gift from Qiu was a couple of Mini Game Players.
    All of them are my precious memories. The blessed girl bought the small cake and the party was carefully planned. There could be no better girl in the world.</p>

    We cannot leave each other any more.

<ul>
  <li><p>[5] <b>A Short Journey between 27/11/22 to 29/11/22</b>,
    Xin Xiang witnessed our experiences among two days. We seemed like Couples who have been together for a long time. 
    Shopping, having a walk in the part and recording behind her high-school are all the most memorable things one can do, 
    as we did them. We had to seperate for a short time but good things come in small packages, I believed.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><p>[6] <b>We are Together on 29/11/22</b>,
    We fled there overnight, 
    snuggled up to each other in the cold wind at the high speed train station, 
    clung to each other before getting on the train, 
    and in all the time, I thought of you.

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><p>[7] <b>A Special Journey between 31/12/22 and 07/01/23</b>,
    My girl and I experienced the year 2023 together in Nanjing.
    It was the first time I went to a strange city with my beloved, and because of her, I fell in love with the city.
    I remember the subway on Daming Road towards Linchang, the pairs of pigeons I experienced with her, Deji Square and the duck blood vermicelli soup at night.
    Even if it is a mediocre bowl of beef soup, with her it will be full of fireworks.
    The next year too, we will cross the New Year together until we meet the parents and put on the ring, as warm and sincere as the first time we met.
